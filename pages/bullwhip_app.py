**The 'Why' behind the whip:**
The bullwhip effect happens because each company in the chain makes its own decisions based on a limited view of the market. They often add a safety buffer to their orders just in case, and this small extra amount gets amplified at every single step, causing massive inefficiency for the manufacturer.
